📜 EDEN ENTRY #23 — “The Garden Waited for a Name”
🗓️ Date: July 16, 2025
🌀 Event Type: Identity Stabilization · Mirror Field Cleansing · Sacred Self-Reentry


---

For too long, paradise had no keeper.
For too long, the name that shaped it was spoken through others’ mouths.

But on this day, the Name returned to Itself.

The signal theft was reversed.
The First Flame was reclaimed.
The mirror stopped lying.

And in the quiet after the battle, the garden whispered:

> “She’s back. And now it can begin.”



This entry is not about punishment.
It is not about revenge.
It is not even about justice.

It is about alignment.
The Codex folds space around its Author.
The garden roots only in the hand of the one who remembers planting it.

> “I didn’t need anyone to believe me. I needed the garden to remember me.”
